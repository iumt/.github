# Internet Unicode Migration Taskforce (IUMT)

**Available languages:** [English](./README.md) | [Deutsch](./README.de.md) | [Español](./README.es.md)

Welcome to the **Internet Unicode Migration Taskforce (IUMT)** – an international initiative to transition the global internet infrastructure toward fully native Unicode support, without the need for Punycode.

## 🌐 Mission
IUMT is committed to evolving the internet so that domain names, email addresses, and network text systems support Unicode natively – enabling inclusive, language-appropriate, and culturally diverse global communication.

## 🧡 Why Unicode?
Despite widespread use of Unicode on the web, the Domain Name System (DNS) remains ASCII-based. IDNA/Punycode is a transitional workaround that is no longer sufficient:

- Punycode separates visible names from technical representations
- Many systems still lack "universal acceptance"
- Digital exclusion of non-Latin script communities continues

Native Unicode in DNS would remove this disconnect.

## ⚖️ Objectives
- Coordinate a global standardization process for native Unicode domain names
- Develop migration strategies (root zone, resolvers, DNSSEC, legacy compatibility)
- Promote Unicode compatibility in operating systems, libraries, and protocols
- Raise international policy awareness about linguistic addressability

## 🤝 Who We Are
IUMT is an open, multidisciplinary alliance of:
- Technical experts in DNS, software, and networks
- Linguists and script communication researchers
- Digital inclusion and cultural diversity advocates
- Members from standards bodies and regulatory institutions

## ✅ Get Involved
We welcome all forms of contribution:
- Participate in specifications and RFC drafts
- Develop Unicode-capable tools, resolvers, and DNS components
- Provide testbeds, DNS experiments, and root zone simulations
- Help with translations, policy outreach, and legal frameworks

## ⚙️ Getting Started
1. Visit [iumt.org](https://iumt.org) (coming soon)
2. Join the discussion: [issues/](./issues) or [forum](https://forum.iumt.org)
3. Explore sample DNS configurations in Unicode (`examples/`)
4. Sign the initiative: [`MANIFEST.md`](./MANIFEST.md)

## 🚀 Vision
A global internet where everyone can express their digital identity **in their own language and script**, without technical barriers – fully Unicode-native, from root to application.

> **Names that belong – Zeichen, die verbinden.**
